<h1 id="promiseland-exhibition">Promiseland Exhibition</h1>
<p>Promiseland was an exhibition at A-Venue on Kungsportsavenyn in Gothenburg on the theme Migration. The exhibition was open for two weeks in January 2016. Together with my class at HDK, I was responsible for creating a concept for the exhibition, plan the space, produce all the graphic material and market the exhibition. Personally, I was responsible for working with the exhibition&#39;s spatial concept and, above all, to design and build parts of the room&#39;s entrance. The items exhibited were created by master students at HDK.</p>
<p>Promiseland got great publicity and reviews, broke the record number of visitors at A-Venue, and was covered by P4 Göteborg (radio), SVT Väst (television) and GöteborgsPosten (newspaper).</p>
