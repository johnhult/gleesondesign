Located at the bottom of Kungsportsavenyn in central Gothenburg, it is close to walking paths and areas where people tend to gather, but at the same time away from the most busy streets. The first page of famous literary works are displayed on a glass wall, giving visitors an opportunity to &quot;test read&quot; several introductions of books, and if they find a favourite, they can take a stroll up the street and borrow it at the public library.</p>
<p>The purpose of Room for Reading is to be an easily accessible space, inviting and introducing the public to classic literature. The pages displayed on the glass wall can be changed to highlight and showcase different genres/themes.</p>
