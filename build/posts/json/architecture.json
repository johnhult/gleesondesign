  "art1 - roomforreading.html": "<h1 id=\"room-for-reading\">Room for Reading</h1>\n<p>Room for Reading is a public space designed to encourage people to read books. Located at the bottom of Kungsportsavenyn in central Gothenburg, it is close to walking paths and areas where people tend to gather, but at the same time away from the most busy streets. The first page of famous literary works are displayed on a glass wall, giving visitors an opportunity to &quot;test read&quot; several introductions of books, and if they find a favourite, they can take a stroll up the street and borrow it at the public library.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Room for Reading is to be an easily accessible space, inviting and introducing the public to classic literature. The pages displayed on the glass wall can be changed to highlight and showcase different genres/themes.</p>\n",
  "art2 - interiorekan.html": "<h1 id=\"interior-design-at-ekan-management\">Interior Design at Ekan Management</h1>\n<p>The project was assigned to Christopher together with Josefin Boman, master student in Marketing and Consumption at the School of Economics at the University of Gothenburg. They got the assignment through Miljöbron, a company that works to highlight good environmental work and to connect students with the industry. The project was done at Ekan Management, a management consulting firm with offices in central Gothenburg. </p>\n<p>Ekan are certified and work to be environmentally responsible, but they want to develop and make their environmental work more visible, both to employees and customers. During the project, Christopher and Josefin presented a way of making this happen with relatively small means. The proposal included both practical solutions on how to make the sorting at the office both clearer and simpler, and examples of how the design of the office can make the environment and sustainability more present. Hopefully these relatively small changes affect employees and customers, both consciously and unconsciously, and make environmental awareness a natural part of their everyday lives.</p>\n",
  "art3 - leaveyourmark.html": "<h1 id=\"leave-your-mark\">Leave Your Mark</h1>\n<p>Leave Your Mark is a concept developed for the Museum of World Culture in Gothenburg, consisting of a portable satellite installation in Bergsjön in the north-east of the city. The idea is to connect the people of Bergsjön and let them share their experiences and personal history with each other. </p>\n<p>On the concrete cylinder visitors are encouraged to draw or write messages to future visitors. Inside the cylinder there is a 360 degree projection of the square outside. There is also a computer where visitors are encouraged to enter a place or square they have visited. A projection of the place will be downloaded from Google Street View and added to a database. As more people enter the cylinder, the database will grow. New visitors can choose to view any of the projections in the database, i.e. a place that a former visitor has visited. This will highlight and show the great diversity and experience shared within a relatively small area like Bergsjön.</p>\n",
  "art4 - promiseland.html": "<h1 id=\"promiseland-exhibition\">Promiseland Exhibition</h1>\n<p>Promiseland was an exhibition at A-Venue on Kungsportsavenyn in Gothenburg on the theme Migration. The exhibition was open for two weeks in January 2016. Together with my class at HDK, I was responsible for creating a concept for the exhibition, plan the space, produce all the graphic material and market the exhibition. Personally, I was responsible for working with the exhibition&#39;s spatial concept and, above all, to design and build parts of the room&#39;s entrance. The items exhibited were created by master students at HDK.</p>\n<p>Promiseland got great publicity and reviews, broke the record number of visitors at A-Venue, and was covered by P4 Göteborg (radio), SVT Väst (television) and GöteborgsPosten (newspaper).</p>\n"
