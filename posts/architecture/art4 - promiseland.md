# Promiseland Exhibition

Promiseland was an exhibition at A-Venue on Kungsportsavenyn in Gothenburg on the theme Migration. The exhibition was open for two weeks in January 2016. Together with my class at HDK, I was responsible for creating a concept for the exhibition, plan the space, produce all the graphic material and market the exhibition. Personally, I was responsible for working with the exhibition's spatial concept and, above all, to design and build parts of the room's entrance. The items exhibited were created by master students at HDK.

Promiseland got great publicity and reviews, broke the record number of visitors at A-Venue, and was covered by P4 Göteborg (radio), SVT Väst (television) and GöteborgsPosten (newspaper).
