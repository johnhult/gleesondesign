<h1 id="leave-your-mark">Leave Your Mark</h1>
<p>Leave Your Mark is a concept developed for the Museum of World Culture in Gothenburg, consisting of a portable satellite installation in Bergsjön in the north-east of the city. The idea is to connect the people of Bergsjön and let them share their experiences and personal history with each other. </p>
<p>On the concrete cylinder visitors are encouraged to draw or write messages to future visitors. Inside the cylinder there is a 360 degree projection of the square outside. There is also a computer where visitors are encouraged to enter a place or square they have visited. A projection of the place will be downloaded from Google Street View and added to a database. As more people enter the cylinder, the database will grow. New visitors can choose to view any of the projections in the database, i.e. a place that a former visitor has visited. This will highlight and show the great diversity and experience shared within a relatively small area like Bergsjön.</p>
