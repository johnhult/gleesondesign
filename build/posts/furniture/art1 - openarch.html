<h1 id="open-arch">Open Arch</h1>
<p>Open Arch started as a school project together with Petra Andersson in prep school at Art College in Gothenburg. An early prototype was shown at the Stockholm Furniture and Light Fair in 2014. Since then I have refined and worked on the chair in collaboration with Lundbergs MÃ¶bler, launching at the Stockholm Furniture and Light Fair in 2016.</p>
<p>Open Arch has a classic design but challenges the norm. An Arch is one of the strongest structures in architecture and the name Open Arch refers to a combination of being strong and at the same time open. The design clearly flirts with Scandinavian furniture tradition, but is contemporary and innovative. The asymmetry of the chair enables interesting seating arrangements and in groups the chair creates different situations and desired directions in a room.</p>
