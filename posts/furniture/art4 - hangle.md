# Hangle

Hangle is a shelf with a somewhat upside down look. Instead of being supported with regular brackets, the shelf hangs inside two triangles of bent copper. Simple and graceful, Hangle suits just about any room.

The copper is unpolished and slightly worn, which creates a clear contrast to the white and smooth shelf. The choice of material connects with the swedish copper tradition and the shelf itself is made from solid swedish birch.
